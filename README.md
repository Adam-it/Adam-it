### Hi there 👋

🙋‍♂️I am nothing special. Just a typical dev that likes to code (.Net, C#, SharePoint, Microsoft 365, JavaScript, TypeScript, React ... are my world 🌎). 

👨‍💻Besides normal work (which is mainly coding) I like to code for the community. Usually things for SharePoint and Microsoft 365. 

✍️Besides coding I try a bit of blogging contributing my knowledge to [PnP Blog](https://github.com/pnp/blog/)
