### Hi there 👋

I am nothing special... just a typical dev that likes to code (.Net, C#, SharePoint, Microsoft 365, javascript, typescript, React, Xamarin ... are my world 🌎). Besides normal work (which is mainly coding) I like to code for the community. Usually with Open Source I focus on webparts and extensions and other things for SharePoint and Microsoft 365.

If you like my work or find it helpful let me know 👍

You may reach me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/adam-w%C3%B3jcik-9b7777a6/)

Besides Open Source I also try to support the community on StackOverflow (usually SharePoint stuff 😉):
- [stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/users/11672309/adam)
- [sharepoint.stackexchange](https://sharepoint.stackexchange.com/users/84913/adam)
